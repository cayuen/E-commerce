# CS 137 Assignment 1

NOTE: For better file organization, I ended up separating all my files into 4 folders (html, css, img, and js). When accessing a page directly (e.g. index.html), please input the appropriate folder name before the file name (e.g. /html/index.html).

Main page URL: http://centaurus-4.ics.uci.edu:1207/html/index.html

Requirements:
(1) Overview of your business: /html/about.html
	Products you sell: /html/about.html and /html/products.html
	Management team: /html/team.html

(2) List of products in a table: /html/products.html

(3) Image of each product in a cell: /html/products.html

(4) Product price and other information: /html/products.html

(5) Product leads to new detail page: /html/item-<num>.html. The <num> can be a number 1-13, since I have included 13 products.

(6) Order form: /html/item-<num>.html. See above.

(7) Form sends an email: not included in site

(8) Form checked for formatting: /html/item-<num>.html. Only partially completed.

(9) CSS properities: see all pages (background, font, item placement, predetermined image size, nav bar,text alignment, icon home button, box outlines, nav options change color, multiple choice shipping method format in product form)

(10) Increase image size: /html/products.html
